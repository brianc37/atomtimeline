				<p>He was a Greek philosopher who was a chief critic of Democritus’ atomos theory and a predominant reason it didn’t catch on until over a thousand years later. He believed that all materials were composed of varying amounts of earth, water, air, and fire.</p>

				<p>He was a Greek philosopher who theorized that if you cut stone in half it kept its properties, you could keep cutting it until you reached the smallest piece of stone that of which would be indivisible; he named these atomos. He believed all materials have different sized and shaped atomos that, when collided, could form new materials and stick or rebound.</p>

				<p>He was a meteorologist for most of his life which led him to research the nature of gases, eventually leading to the basis of his atomic theory. His theory was all matter was made of indivisible indestructible atoms, all atoms of an element have the same properties, compounds are formed by two or more different atoms, and a chemical reaction is just a rearrangement of atoms.</p>

				<p>In 1879, he performed experiments where he sent an electric current through a gas in a sealed tube. The particles, called cathode rays, were thought to be negatively charged atoms until they were found to be able to pass through other materials; he was important for J.J. Thompson to perform tests confirming electrons. </p>

				<img align="center" src="./pics/plum.jpg" style="width:300px;height:180px">
				<p>In 1897, he performed tests with cathode ray tubes and discovered there were negatively charged particles in an atom called electrons, this discovery required a new atom structure to account for electrons. He created the plum pudding model where a positively charged cloud had negative particles embedded.</p>

				<p>In 1909, his water drop experiment discovered that droplets had multiples of an elementary electric charge. In 1910, his oil drop experiment had given precise measurements on the electrical charge of a single electron.</p>

				<img align="center" src="./pics/planet.jpg" style="width:300px;height:180px">
				<p>In 1911, he did his famous gold foil experiment where he launched many alpha particles at a very thin piece of gold foil and saw how they reacted. This allowed him to create his Ruther Model of the atom where the nucleus is a tiny, dense, positively charged core where almost all mass is located and is circled randomly by electrons. He also theorized atoms are mostly empty space.</p>

				<p>Discovered the neutron in 1932(under direction from Rutherford), a particle that makes up the nucleus with protons and has no electrical charge. He bombarded beryllium with alpha particles and noticed an unknown radiation was ejected out of the atom that was capable of knocking protons out of other atoms. He soon theorized that this radiation was a particle weighing slightly more than a proton with no charge.</p>
